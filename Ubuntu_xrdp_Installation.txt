1. Verify xrdp Installation and Service Status
Ensure xrdp is properly installed and running.

a. Check if xrdp is installed:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt list --installed | grep xrdp
If it's not installed, install it:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install xrdp
b. Check if xrdp is running:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status xrdp
If it’s not running, start and enable it:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
2. Verify Firewall Settings
Make sure the firewall allows Remote Desktop connections (usually on port 3389 for xrdp).

a. Check if the port is open:
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
b. Allow port 3389 if it's not listed:
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 3389
c. Enable firewall if it’s inactive:
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw enable
3. Configure the Desktop Environment for xrdp
By default, Ubuntu MATE may not be configured for xrdp. You need to set the desktop session for xrdp.

a. Create a .xsession file:
bash
Copy code
echo mate-session > ~/.xsession
b. Restart xrdp service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
4. Verify Network Security Group (NSG) Rules in Azure
Ensure that your Azure Network Security Group (NSG) allows traffic on port 3389:

a. Go to your VM’s Networking tab in the Azure portal.
b. Check the Inbound port rules and make sure there’s a rule to allow TCP traffic on port 3389.
If it’s missing, add a rule for TCP 3389:

Click Add inbound port rule.
Set the Destination port ranges to 3389.
Set Protocol to TCP.
Action should be set to Allow.
5. Reconnect via Remote Desktop Client
Use your VM's public IP address to connect.
Ensure you're using the correct credentials (username and password you set during the VM setup).
6. Check Logs for Errors
If you're still unable to connect, you can check the xrdp logs for any errors:

bash
Copy code
cat /var/log/xrdp.log
cat /var/log/xrdp-sesman.log
These logs might provide additional information on why the connection fails.

7. Reboot the VM
Sometimes a simple reboot can resolve issues:

bash
Copy code
sudo reboot
8. Verify Public IP
Ensure you're using the correct public IP to connect. You can find the public IP in the Azure portal under the VM's Overview section.

Additional Notes:
Make sure you have the xrdp package and mate-session configured correctly as the default session.
If Remote Desktop is still not working, you might consider using VNC as an alternative.
